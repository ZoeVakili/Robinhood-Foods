                    Our food is donated, but don't worry, we promise
                it's bacteria free! Before we put our food out on sale,
                we hire a professional bacteria checker to make sure
                that the food is clear of any bacteria. We also check our
                food every few days to make sure that no bacteria builds 
                up overnight. Some food needs certain conditions to stay
                bacteria free. Like meat, it has to stay cold to keep bacteria
                out. We spend extra money just to make sure that the food that 
                we give is safe for everyone to eat! We also label the ingredients
                 to make sure that you know whats in the food that you're buying.
